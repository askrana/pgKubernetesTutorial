Kube-Native PostgreSQL

The Goal
  postgresctl deploy postgres-1

Patroni Refresher
  How it works

Kube-Integrated Patroni
  - moving from separate etcd to kube api
    - standard patroni
    - new model
  - how leader election works
    - endpoint vs configmap
    - leader election?

Operator Status
  - Crunchy Operator
    - crunchy implementation
    - operator functions
  - patroni operator
    - current functions
    - implementation chart

Limitations/future work
  - complete operator
  - Need separate CLI
  - Statefulset scaling down the master
  - No elegant way to handle config files
  - security issues?
  - growing disk space
  - failing over federation
  - Postgres Logical replication
